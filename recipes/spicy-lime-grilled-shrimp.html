    <h2 class="recipe-name">Spicy Lime Grilled Shrimp recipe</h2>

    <p class="recipe-description">
      Spicy lime grilled shrimp bring together smoky char, tender texture, and a
      burst of bold flavor. Marinated in a lively mix of lime juice, chili heat,
      and aromatic spices such as cumin, paprika, and garlic, these shrimp
      deliver a balance of zesty brightness and savory depth with every bite.

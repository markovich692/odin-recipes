    <h2>Spicy Lime Grilled Shrimp recipe</h2>

    <p>
      Spicy lime grilled shrimp bring together smoky char, tender texture, and a
      burst of bold flavor. Marinated in a lively mix of lime juice, chili heat,
      and aromatic spices such as cumin, paprika, and garlic, these shrimp
      deliver a balance of zesty brightness and savory depth with every bite.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (such as Emeril's Essence)</li>

          Cook shrimp on the preheated grill until bright pink on the outside

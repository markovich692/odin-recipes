    <h2 class="recipe-name">California Roll Recipe</h2>

    <p class="recipe-description">
      The California Roll is a popular inside-out sushi (uramaki) where the
      seasoned rice wraps around the ingredients instead of the seaweed. This
      flavorful roll typically combines crisp cucumber, creamy avocado, and
      sweet crab or imitation crab, creating a perfect balance of texture and
      taste in every bite.

    <h3 class="ingredients__title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients__list">
      <li class="ingredients__item">1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">1 cup water</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">
        1/2cup imitation crabmeat, finely chopped
      </li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">8 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">2 1/2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">1 cucumber, cut into thin spears</li>
      <li class="ingredients__item">
        2 avocados-pitted, peeled, and sliced the long way
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps__title">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps__list">
      <li class="steps__item">
        Wash the rice in several changes of water until the rinse water is no
        longer cloudy, drain well, and place in a covered pan or rice cooker
        with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover
        the pan. Allow the rice to simmer until the top looks dry, about 15
        minutes. Turn off the heat, and let stand for 10 minutes to absorb the
        rest of the water.
      </li>

      <li class="steps__item">
        Mix the rice vinegar and sugar in a small bowl until the sugar has
        dissolved, and stir the mixture into the cooked rice until well
        combined. Allow the rice to cool, and set aside.
      </li>

      <li class="steps__item">
        Mix the imitation crabmeat with mayonnaise in a bowl, and set aside. To
        roll the sushi, cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay a
        sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap. With wet fingers,
        firmly pat a thin, even layer of prepared rice over the nori, leaving
        1/4 inch uncovered at the bottom edge of the sheet. Sprinkle the rice
        with about 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds, and gently press them into the
        rice. Carefully flip the nori sheet over so the seaweed side is up.
      </li>

      <li class="steps__item">
        Place 2 or 3 long cucumber spears, 2 or 3 slices of avocado, and about 1
        tablespoon of imitation crab mixture in a line across the nori sheet,
        about 1/4 from the uncovered edge. Pick up the edge of the bamboo
        rolling sheet, fold the bottom edge of the sheet up, enclosing the
        filling, and tightly roll the sushi into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inch in
        diameter. Once the sushi is rolled, wrap it in the mat and gently
        squeeze to compact it tightly.
      </li>

      <li class="steps__item">
        Cut each roll into 1 inch pieces with a very sharp knife dipped in
        water.

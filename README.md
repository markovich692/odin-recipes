RECIPE WEBSITE

This project is a simple recipe website, created to demonstrate my HTML proficiency.
It also serves as an opportunity to:

    *   Practice organizing files and directories in a clean, structured way
    *   Apply my knowledge of the Command Line Interface (CLI)
    *   Strengthen my understanding of the Git workflow by tracking changes as   as the project evolves
